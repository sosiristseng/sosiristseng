## Hi Wen-Wei here ðŸ‘‹

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sosiristseng/sosiristseng/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg)

A PhD student of the Biomedical Systems Engineering (BMSE) lab from the [Graduate institude of Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics (BEBI)](http://www.bebi.ntu.edu.tw/web/index/index.jsp), [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw). I'm currently studying the functions of **mitochondria**, the powerhouse of the cell, via _in silico_ studies  (a.k.a. computer simulations).

## Working on

* Mitochodrial dynamics in response to energy status and external stimuli.
* Mitochodnrial function, reactive oxygen species, and cardiac electrophysiology.

## Currently investigating

* Quantitative systems pharmocology (Qsp)
* Biological systems modeling in Julia
  * Differential equations
  * Parameter estimation and optimization
  * Uncertainty quantification
  * Scietific ML
  * Multithreading, multiprocessing, and GPUs
* How to present my thoughts and code effectively, on my [knowledge base](https://sosiristseng.github.io).
